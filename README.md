## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amirhossein-2020/statues-game.git
cd statues-game
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
pipenv shell
=======
```

## Pensieri a caso:

- Fare il check all'inizio del gioco quando tutti i giocatori sono in posizione, rifare il check solo quando il numero dei giocatori diventa diverso dal numero che sono all'inizio.
- Cambiare yolo face con haar cascade (molto pi√π leggero)

## Baba Jaga game
It is a real-time computer vision game inspired by "Red Light, Green Light". Players move during the "green light" (moving phase) and must freeze during the "red light" (frozen phase). If a player moves during the frozen state, they are eliminated. The game uses webcam input, pose detection, and face recognition to track players and enforce rules.

Used for capturing video frames, image preprocessing, visual annotations, and fullscreen rendering.

- YOLOv11-pose | 8.3.126  
Performs keypoint detection to track player movement across frames. Used to determine if a player moved during the frozen phase.

- YOLOv11-face | 8.3.126  
Detects and extracts player faces from webcam frames to be passed into the recognition pipeline.

- DeepFace | 0.0.93  
Performs face recognition. Identifies players and assigns persistent IDs across game sessions.

- pygame (planned)  
To be used for music and sound effect playback during game events (start, freeze, elimination, etc).
